# SDL P/Invoke Redistributables

This repository contains code for automated [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) binary building & packaging. This project is built to work with [flibitijibibo's bindings](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS), though this package could theoretically work with any P/Invoke bindings.
